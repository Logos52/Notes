# Price Optimization

https://www.notion.so/6-Startup-Pricing-101-ba14d066b0e74be99dc17ab1bd781c47

Start with the Demand/Yield curve
How much do I charge vs. how much sales optimization do I get?

### 10-5-20 rule
10: Value = 10x price.  ie. you want the value to be 10x the price of whatever it is you're charging
Charge a product for $10, perceived value for the product should be $100
5: Raise the price by 5%
20: keep raising the price until you lose 20% of your customers

Notes: optimization is a fancy way of squeezing as much a possible while still being sustainable. You could argue the system is bad faith
