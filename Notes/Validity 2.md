## Validity

Validity is the logical foundation of a [[Concept]], which strengthens the accuracy of a concept's representation of the real world.

The word "valid" is from the Latin "validus", meaning strength.

Validity theory is based around this strength. It is not something that has an on/off state, like true or false. It's a gauge of sorts. Similar with trust. The more evidence there is, the more valid it becomes.

The logical definition does have that on/off definition, but "validity theory" requires a concept to be tested via all methods:

** Construct validity
accumulation of evidence

** Content validity
An examination of tests used to determine validity

** Scientific Validity
Scientific method plus research ethics. The scientific method is a systemic approach to reduce bias as much as possible, whereas research ethics involves methods that do no harm to people, the environment, or other living things.
