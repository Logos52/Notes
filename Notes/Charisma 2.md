# Charisma

Defined as "attractiveness toward engagement" aka "sociability". i.e. How well a person can engage and draw [[engagement]] from others.

The best type of Charisma is optimized for "positive" engagement in a wide variety of people, but also minimize the amount of bad engagement.
e.g. someone who is misogynistic can still create engagement with a group that shares the same values.

[Wikipedia: Charisma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisma): From the Greek χάρισμα (khárisma) which means "favor freely given" or "gift of grace".

Related to signaling theory, because it relies on implicit signals designed to increase likability and engagement. Dogs are inherently charismatic. You can say it's an evolutionary requirement for social animals to have it.

Social skills, making friends, socializing, etc.

It's much easier to make friends among people who share the same values, to reduce the probability of friction or awkwardness

Charisma is heavily contingent
