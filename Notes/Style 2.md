# Style


A manner of execution or presentation that is considered to be memorable, personal, or highly identifiable.

Style is considered to be highly contingent, meaning it is unique to the presenter, & serves as a sort of "brain priming," to trigger the brain to prepare for a set of input the brain may already be familiar with.

Fundamentally speaking, styles are a collection of methods, mindsets, and behaviors.

Characters from Japanese anime usually have one exaggerated feature to distinguish them from others. Like a logo they wear on their body.
Eg. Big ears or large glasses. Harry Potter scar+spectacles.

The reason why Uniqlo is so popular is that the clothes are designed to recede into the background. [[迷惑]] in fashion. Letting other features take center stage.

From the book "The Elements of Style" (A book about writing)
>Write in a way that draws the reader's attention the sense and substance of the writing, rather than to the mood and temper of the author. If the writing is good, the mood & temper of the author will be revealed and not at the expense of the work. To achieve style, begin by affecting none -- that is, place yourself in the background.

>A careful and honest writer does not need to worry about style. As you become proficient in the use of language, your style will emerge, because you yourself will emerge, and when this happens you will find it increasingly easy to break through the barriers that separate you from other minds, other hearts -- which is, of course, the purpose of writing, as well as its principal reward.

>Fortunately, the act of composition, or creation, disciplines the mind; writing is one way to go about thinking, and the practice and habit of writing not only drain the mind but supply it, too.
