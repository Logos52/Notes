# Bias

From [Wikipedia: Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias): a disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea or thing

It's similar with the word "error" but implies the error is systemic or preventable.

Imagine you are trying to shoot a magazine at a target with an assault rifle. If your gun is not calibrated properly, it creates a shot group that is off-center.  Bias is the distance between that target and the center of your shot group.

Bias implies you need "calibration" to align your mental thinking.

The problem is, you don't see a target when you shoot, so the alignment doesn't give proper feedback. People can get stuck in ways of thinking that are resistant to calibration because the feedback is perpetuated by others who share the same feedback. See: [[Mimetic theory]] ie. everyone's targets calibrate to everyone else's targets.
