## Contingency

Contingency is the level of "uniqueness" in the aspects of an entity, such as a human, book, etc.

Certain entities and concepts are composed of a highly contingent set of probabilistic circumstances that make it almost mathematically impossible, (P = 0.000...) that a perfect copy exists, assuming even an infinite number of possible universes.
ie. some change (to society) that would not have occurred for a long time, or ever.
Eg. "Game of Thrones" is a novel that would never exactly have been written by anyone else. A very unique set of circumstances.

Non-contingent means: the change would have happened regardless.
Eg. Calculus was independently discovered twice

Formal definition:
[From Wikipedia: Wonderful Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderful_Life_(book))
Contingency: "The process by which historical outcomes arise from an unpredictable sequence of antecedent states, where any change in the sequence alters the final result"

We live in a world state that is highly contingent on past affairs. Eg. the island of Japan is vastly effected by both its geography, history, temperament, etc. If you were to re-roll the "Tape of Life", the combination of events would produce an entirely different country in Japan. Even a small change in the past would create a different country altogether.

From Stephen Jay Gould , it is not "randomness" but "contingency", which would create this new country.

And depending on when you roll back the "Tape of Life" you might find that human level intelligence is highly unlikely to rise ever again.

“Even if fishes hone their adaptations to peaks of aquatic perfection, they will all die if the pond dries up. But grubby old buster the lungfish, former laughing stock of the piscine priesthood, may pull through - and not because a bunion on his great-grandfather’s fin warned his ancestors about an impending comet. Buster and his kin may prevail because a feature evolved long ago for a different use has fortuitously permitted survival during a sudden and unpredictable change in the rules. And if we are Buster’s legacy, and the result of a thousand other similarly happy accidents, how can we possibly view our mentality as inevitable, or even probable?” - Stephen Jay Gould
