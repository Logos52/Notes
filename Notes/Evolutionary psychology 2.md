## Evolutionary psychology

A [[Mental model]] which states that most of our behaviors and emotions have been evolutionarily shaped over generations of ancestors.

Our internal mechanisms, adaptations, emotions. Even ones we think of as bad or negative: laziness, greed, anger, etc. Were at one point critical for our evolution and gave our evolutionary ancestors an advantage.

The current theory is that behaviors (temperament, emotions) and evolutionary physical traits (opposing thumbs, teeth) have evolved through similar mechanisms.

Since behaviors are extensions of the brain, they are all technically part of the same body. Certain behaviors carry over through the generations. Culture is the DNA of the human mind. Different cultural traits vie for supremacy. via survival and reproduction, no different from DNA.

Our mind is based on adaptive changes that originated in the Pleistocene era.  (aka the Ice Age, a period that lasted from 2,580,000 to 11,700 y.a.)

Our ancestors had problems and developed ways of solving them. These traits become evolutionarily selected for survival and gave our ancestors an advantage over those who didn't have it.

Our brain is a physical system that instructs us to behave in a manner adaptive to our environment.

### Behaviors
Language

### Phobias
Humans are more likely to fear small threats, like snakes and spiders, because these are more difficult to spot. Fear gives enhanced perception & awareness
