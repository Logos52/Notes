# Questions

A request for information. Part of the "call" portion of the [[Feedback]] loop. 
Questions can have many purposes:
The brain's way of reaching out into the universe, with the objective of receiving truth or information in return.  
Questions come in a large number of varieties, and can be good or bad due to the type of [[Framing]].

Types of improper questions:
##### Leading Questions
Question designed via framing, in a way that makes it very clear that the person asking is looking for a specific answer where they have already decided on what is correct.

##### Loaded Questions
Questions designed with "presuppositions" in mind. If the person answers, they indirectly agree to the presuppositions.
Ex: "Who is the monarch of the UK?"
Whatever the answer, the answerer will indirectly agree that there is a UK, and that there is a monarch.
