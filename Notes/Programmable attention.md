## Programmable Attention

A system that orchestrates your repeated attention over time. Examples: spaced repetition system, journaling, curating your web links for a 'read later'

Programmable attention implies there is a programmer of that attention, & programming your own is a result of deliberation. But external sources exist. Eg. social media, which programs your attention based on a mix of your interests and that of advertisers, or agenda promoting agents (political, belief, religion, etc), using algorithms.
