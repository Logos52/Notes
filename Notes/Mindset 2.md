## Mindset

Mindset is a set of heuristics that prime a human for feedback with reality, i.e. the primary working program for a human that processes inputs and generates outputs.
Mindsets come with a feature set of emotions, preprocessed behaviors, etc. 

Not to be confused with a [[Worldview]], which is more strategic, vs. "mindset" which is more tactical. Each one is fundamentally similar in that both are focused on how best to commit resources and attention, but with different (yet often complimentary) goals.
