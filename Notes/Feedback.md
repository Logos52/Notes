# Feedback


The response to an action, given by the receiving entity of the action, generally communicating a mix of the following:
1. the action was received (or not)
2. the received action was positive or negative
3. a response will be produced (or not)

Immediate feedback is powerful in learning. Feedback has a dual purpose:
- it can act as a warning sign that can redirect you from going down a potentially wrong direction, or building a bad habit
- it can act as affirmation for your correct responses, to solidify them in long term memory (Pavlovian response)

Feedback is much less effective depending on the time delay between action and feedback. It gets worse when feedback rarely ever occurs. Examples of this:
Studying:
People sometimes don't notice the ineffectiveness of certain study habits, or being in a state of pseudo-productivity
[[Learned behaviors]]:
Sometimes, people have strange behaviors when talking, eating, etc. If they are used to living alone, or live with a family who does not care about that sort of thing, no one will point it out to them.
These behaviors turn into awkward territory. Not enough to enter into "rude", and not enough for people to want to give them feedback, without appearing to be rude themselves.
