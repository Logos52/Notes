## Concept


Concepts are the "names" of ideas. They are representations of real world patterns, meant to make it easier to understand. Great concepts are simple and accurate.

They are built for the purpose of understanding, but can also be designed or created, built to enhance an interaction with the environment. eg."chair"

A good concept name will do it's best to capture the essence of an idea, even if that name isn't necessarily derived from English. Ex. 迷惑 (to bother), Zettelkasten (Slip-box), Schadenfreude (damage+joy)

The best concepts are ones that are found to be valid (See: validity theory)
Some concepts are built with a foundation of hidden bias, which will cause that concept to become unfavorable over time. (Unless reinforced by some other factor, such as religion or peer pressure, or shown to have an evolutionary advantage)
