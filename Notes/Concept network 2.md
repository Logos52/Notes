## Concept network

A directed graph representing concepts (nodes) and loose associations that connect these concepts (links)
- Nodes (Concepts)
	concepts, concept maps, etc.
- Links (Connections)
	Direction
	Valence 
	 loosely defined as linkage attractiveness, linkage ability. How many nodes are possible for this to link with?
	 Example: someone who is  attractive can possibly be linked with many potential partners

Creating and viewing the link diagram can help find interesting connections & serves as a tool for spaced repetition. ie. reviewing helps solidify the notes in memory

##### Activation
Each neuron or concept becomes a type of pattern recognition that activates others
##### spreading activation
is the scientific fundamental principle explaining the process of creative thinking
In spreading activation, concepts spread out to other concepts

> Brain connectivity is determined by functional demand

##### Connectivity optimization
- Weakly active neurons are likely to seek dendritic experience (dendritic sprouting)
- Strongly active neurons are likely to share their axonal wisdom with other neurons
