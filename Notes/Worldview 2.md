# Worldview

A set of heuristics which define and explain the world. Worldviews are usually closely associated with the identity of a person.

Because of it's closeness with a person, people's identity, principles, careers, etc. become closely intertwined to perhaps be indistinguishable in some cases.

Worldviews can be compatible with others if they do not have principles that clash or are in conflict. eg, capitalism 

Heuristics lose data as a byproduct of simplifying details, thus, worldviews are imperfect by nature.

In general, one a worldview is formed within a person, it attaches itself to the identity of the person, thus forming much of their personality. Future data, whatever its form, will serve to provide evidence in support of it.

Evolutionarily speaking, we need developed worldviews in order for us to gain a competitive advantage of some sort, or adopt a set of competitive advantages.
