# Engagement

Engagement = production + consumption
Input+output, listening+speaking, reading+writing
Usually done together.

This is different from social network, which focuses on the network rather than the activity. A network isn't necessarily engaging in itself.

Engagement is the most primal learning foundation, of which all learning is derived. You can argue that fundamentally they are one and the same. It's a type of immediate [[feedback]] loop.

Engagement is best done when all available resources are brought to bear, mental, physical, or otherwise. If not presented, then at least made available.

Engagement comes with a certain "[[Style]]" unique to the individual, but sometimes that style itself can be a copy of others. Styles are a collection of methods, mindsets, and behaviors.

One key component that's missing is to create an emotional connection, since emotions are considered a resource.
"To paraphrase Einstein, attaining a detailed understanding without forming an emotional connection is lame; while forming an emotional connection without detailed understanding has no enduring power."

There are different forms: social engagement or participation, usually within a social group, student engagement, military engagement, etc.

If you think back to the best times in your life, what were they doing? Some sort of "crunch." For example, a big group project that involved everyone coming together. Studying together for a big test. Other people talk about stuff like a week long meditation trip.
