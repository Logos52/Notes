## Personal experience

Practical knowledge from major life events. Knowledge is created by interpreting these personal experiences

Experience directly correlates to increased ability or adaptability to the world. Since domains of knowledge often intersect, experience can provide buffs to different unrelated situations. (See exapation)

You can think of this as a "deliberate practice" version of life, where your feedback is your level of enjoyment or productivity. You purposefully place yourself in situations where you have to utilize your social skills, ingenuity etc. to navigate. With the expectation of some reward.
