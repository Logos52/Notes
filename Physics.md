## Physics
- the study of the fundamental measurable quantities of the universe 
		(key word: fundamental, eg. velocity, electric fields, kinetic energy)
	- Find relationships between those fundamental measurable quantities
		(eg. Newton's laws, conservation of energy, special relativity)
		Underneath every mathematical idea is a simple conceptual idea
	Simplification of ideas, how do you describe motion?
	Mathematics is a way for humans to simplify relationships between fundamental units, it can apply to all universes
	Physics does that simplification but with fundamental forces of the universe, it applies to only our own universe
	
	- Frame of reference - abstract coordinate system whose origin, orientation, and scale are specified by reference points (geometric points) whose position is identified mathematically and physically 
		For n dimensions, n+1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame
		Q: Then why are degrees of freedom n-1?
			-mathematically, degrees of freedom are the number of dimensions in a random vector, or 
			-the number of "free" components (how many components need to be known for a vector to be determined)
			-number of independent scores (_N_) minus the number of parameters estimated as intermediate steps (one, namely, the sample mean) and is therefore equal to _N_ − 1
			free to vary"
			-need to know the underlying geometry that defines degrees of freedom
			-can vary independently
			"number of data points in the dataset minus the number of constraints or assumptions that are made about the data"
			"number of independent pieces of information that went into calculating the estimate"
			- Imagine that you are studying the heights of a group of people in a population. You measure the height of each person in the group, and you want to determine the average height of the population. The average height of the group can be calculated by summing the heights of all the individuals and dividing by the total number of people in the group.
				In this case, the degrees of freedom is equal to the number of people in the group minus one. This is because there is only one constraint on the data (the requirement that the average height must be calculated), so all of the other heights in the group are free to vary independently. If you have a group of 10 people, the degrees of freedom would be 9, because there are 10 people in the group, and the average height is the only constraint on the data.
	
	Q: Speed vs. velocity?
		Speed is a scalar, measures the distance traveled over time
		Velocity is a vector, change in position over change in time
		How far is an object moving?  
		How far is an object moving with direction?
		So the difference is between distance and change in position?
		- Distance: scalar, how much ground and object has covered
			- Displacement: vector, the distance and direction between start/end points. "How far out of place an object is"
			Ex. For a person walking around a 1 mile track. Distance travelled is 1 mile, but displacement is 0
			Speed for that same person going a track is always constant, but the velocity is always changing
