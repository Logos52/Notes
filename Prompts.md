## Prompts

Similar with a question, a prompt is designed to act as a doorway to engagement on a particular topic.

Prompts are the source of spaced repetition, good prompts will lead to good engagement on a particular topic. 

Even if you know how to do it, it can be difficult

"Retrieval practice is about testing knowledge to produce learning" rather than to assess learning

- Focused
	A question with too much detail will dull your concentration and produce incomplete retrievals, leaving some parts unlit
	Unfocused questions also make it harder for you to check whether you remembered all parts of the answer, and note places where you differed. 
	Focused prompts are usually one detail at a time
	You can reinforce and add meaning to factual prompts by adding prompts about why that fact is true
- Consistent
	should light the same lights every time, otherwise, you may run into an interface phenomenon known as "retrieval-induced forgetting", what you remember during practice is remembered, but related knowledge which you didn't recall is actually inhibited
- Tractable
	To avoid recurring annoyance, you should strive to write prompts where you can almost always answer correctly, this often means breaking the task down, or adding cues
- Effortful
	The prompt actually involves retrieving the answer from memory, & you shouldn't be able to trivially infer the answer. 
	Lack a focused target: the answers may be imprecise or inconsistent
	Tightly scoped questions is difficult, need to break down into discrete components so you can build these pieces back up as prompts for retrieval practice

Two skills: how to characterize what knowledge to reinforce, how to ask questions 
Characterizations of knowledge:
- Factual
- Procedural
- Conceptual

Others:
Provisional: beliefs or conclusions based on incomplete data or evidence

Elaborative encoding - make information easier to recall when connecting it to other memories


Simple facts
	- focuses on just one detail
	- precise about what it wants
	- consistent answer over time
	- tractable, but still demands retrieving the answer from memory
	- What... 
Explanation-type prompts
	- Valuable when studying procedures, they can help avoid rote learning and build deeper understanding. eg. one level of "why"
	- Write these when the detail seems challenging, or when the explanation itself is interesting
	- Q: Why do we xxxx?

Useful lenses for understanding concepts:
- Attributes & Tendencies
	*What* makes it? What's always, sometimes, never true?
- Similarities & differences
	*How* does it relate to other adjacent concepts?
- Parts & wholes
	*What* are some examples? are there important sub-concepts?
- Causes & effects
	What does it do? What causes it?
- Significance & implications
	*Why* does it matter? What does it suggest?

- Salience prompts and the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon
	BM-p is a kind of selective attention: new ideas are salient, so we notice them more readily. They haven't really become more common, they just seem that way

- False positives
	Discourage pattern matching
		Mechanical pattern association
		Cloze deletions seem susceptible to this problem
	Avoid binary prompts
