E-ink reader, utilization, pdfs, Chinese content?
TODO: Obsidian Migration
Obsidian

Decided to try and make the process as fun as possible.
I use Obsidian for taking notes, but it doesn't work well for Chinese
I will use ChatGPT for Chinese, figure out some method  for notes/capture. Maybe Obsidian also is fine
Game in Chinese, maybe Skyrim?
Use it extensively for any purpose (eg. one's hobby)
To make using Chinese easy, acquisition fast, memory needs some assistance. This is best done with [[Spaced repetition]]

Process first thinking
I have been thinking lately about how to overcome my problems with Chinese. Most of the content I would like to learn in Chinese is boring, so it makes me not interested in it.

Two fundamental things you need to learn a language:
- Extensive use of the language (for any purpose, including hobbies)
- memory support from spaced repetition

There are also two types of focus goals when planning: outcome vs. process. It sounds obvious, but I need to focus more on figuring out a process that is sustainable, something fun that makes me want to keep doing it, and something interesting enough that keeps my brain engaged & learning

Too easy, you won't improve. Too hard, you lose motivation. Finding "perfect method" becomes a rabbit hole in itself. Perfect methods are a result of trial and error and highly personalized to the person. 

先想【過程】，
最近我一直在想我的中文。 大多數用中文寫的東西都很無聊，所以我【遠離】它。

這個【網站】說：學習一門語言有【兩個基本要求】：
- 廣泛使用該語言（出於任何目的，包括興趣愛好）
- 間隔重複的內存支持

時也有兩種【類型的重點目標】：【結果】和【過程】。 這聽起來很【明顯】，但我需要更多【地關找出】一個【可持續的過程】


* Daily Notes
	Templates? Front matter?
	DNP - workflow management tool, vs. a place to capture
	Cons:
	Sometimes mixing in work + personal can lead to conflicts
	- context collapse
		audiences self-segregate into two entities with different roles, "collapsed context"
		Context:  objects, entities, etc. surround a focal event
		a "frame" that surrounds the event, and provides resources for a type of interpretation. Therefore it's relative concept, only definable within that specific frame, and not independent of it
	feel obligated to journal things that don't really provide future value
- Tools for thought
	Templates: providing a consistent way to handle repeating activities
	Flashcard writing prompts, daily stoic
	
* Programmable attention
	Building & curating your list, ie. raindrop, pocket, rss feeds, twitter with the goal of orchestrating your repeated attention 
	ie. spaced repetition systems, it's necessary but what's more so is the "why" ie. the Underlayer of what you choose to spaced repeat

Open to-do list
DP -  7h, $3500 
Boox - research how other people use it, pdfs, notes, etc. 
Notes, etc. 

- Spaced repetition: 
	- Testing effect aka "retrieval practice"
		- When you try to recall some detail, the act strengthens your memory of that detail, called "Retrieval practice"
		- Active recall
	- Spacing effect
		- 
	- Systematically speaking:

Overall goals to be figured out:
	- Increase amount of active recall, OS level spaced repetition
	- Scheduling design, arrangement

20 rules of knowledge formation
-   [don't learn things that you do not understand](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Do_not_memorize_before_you_understand "Do not memorize before you understand")
	- This rule comes from "Coherence", the degree of meaningful connectedness of memories. Developing coherent memories is more pleasurable. Pleasure is a perfect sensor of efficient learning
	- If you visualize knowledge as a semantic network, coherence is the quality of connectedness between a node and the network. Concepts such as "cat" and "Dog" are similar, therefore they are semantically close. "cat" and "algebra" are usually remotely connected. 
	- High knowledge coherence improves memory via consolidation in sleep. It reduces knowledge interference and favors memory consistency
-   learn before you memorize
-   start from basics before going into complexities
-   [keep questions simple](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Simple_questions_in_spaced_repetition "Simple questions in spaced repetition")
	- Wording of items must be optimized to make sure that in minimum time the right bulb in your brain lights up, this will reduce error rates, increase specificity, reduce response time, help concentration
-   pictures assist memory
-   learn mnemonic techniques, e.g. peg lists
-   avoid lists, sets and enumerations (they can be tackled with [cloze deletion](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion") as in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ktH-TceHx8))
	I don't fully agree with this, lists can help establish patterns behind several pieces of information
-   personalize and provide examples
-   [cloze deletion](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion") is fast and has a great [mnemonic power](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Mnemonic_anchor "Mnemonic anchor")
-   use [redundancy](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Redundancy "Redundancy") (similar [items](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Item "Item") asking similar questions from different angles)
-   use [references](http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References)

Meta rules:
- Pleasure in learning
	if there is a drop in pleasure, is there a way to see if there is a rule violation that might be responsible for the decline in fun?
- Applicability
	We should strive for maximum applicability in learning
	Abstract knowledge is based on rules, rules are employed in multiple contexts, rules are more important than facts


###### Concepts:
* Coherence
* Incremental Reading
	- form a "funnel of knowledge"
	- worldwide web is converted into a "selection of own material"
	- moves to import highlights (extracts)
	- convert into active knowledge (cloze deletion)
	- then made stable in memory
	- acted upon in a creative manner via (problem solving)
* Learn Drive
	natural tendency for the brain to seek new information
	purposely avoids the term "Curiosity", because other terms may be misconstrued, therefore bias is affected. has a scientific definition but also negative connotations in popular use. learn drive is (and is meant to be) wholly positive
	- Conditions: innate, trainable, can be suppressed, not spurred by stress, delivers its own reward, not a personality trait
	Considered highly desirable. Makes us inventors and discoverers. 

- Boredom intolerance
	close to learn drive, but has connotations of impatience
	- Need for cognition
		- playing checkers, satisfies this, but fails to satisfy the learn drive.
	- Novelty seeking
	correlate with impulsivity and thrill, or sensation seeking. Seen as a trait that may lead to behavioral problems
- Suppression of the learn drive
	Boredom: absence of reward from the learn drive system. a healthy brain will resist boredom, and perceive it as a penalty. Children at school are conditioned to tolerate boredom via learned helplessness
	learn drive might have been ravaged and vestigal, & wrongly attributed to the process of aging or even natural development. This is a dangerous falsehood

* Behavioral space
	* set of behaviors in a free-running animal that leads to no penalty (such as pain)
	* The borders of the behavioral space are determined by the environment. In humans, the limits of the behavioral space are tightened w/ the rules of behavior imposed by parents, teachers, social groups etc.
	* In children, with a large behavioral space, exploration makes it impossible to examine a wide range of behaviors for their impact on planning, goal-seeking, strategies, natural reward or penalty, etc. 
	* In a child with small behavioral space, excess authoritarian penalization limits the range of behaviors and may lead to a "War of the networks"
* War of the networks
	major signaling conflict within a neutral control system. The conflict is resolved by a set of mechanisms of which neuronal death is the most drastic
	- When two neural networks stand in opposition, they compete to reconcile their signals. 
	- In a simple case, factual contradictions are quickly reconciled, e.g. with a bit of reasoning, or with google
	- ex. when a kid leaves bed before dawn, his sleep control system receives contradictory signals. Circadian control vs. an overriding priority: school
	Best avoided when you have a "Respect for human natural instincts" ie. life in agreement with oneself
		stabilization factors: 
		1. low expectations
		2. advancing towards goals on a mental autopilot
		3. stoic philosophy (makes you see minor setbacks in the perspective of the advancement of one's lifetime goals)

- Toxic memory
	Hate of school, etc.  possible to condition a human being to panic at the sight of a math formula, math etc. becomes a state of anxiety.
	fear paralyzes intellectual capacities that might lead to a rational solution. they are targeted at providing a robotic solution by employing fast thinking. through interference
	
	- useless fear, fear with no purpose at the cost of freedom and long hours of drilling
- Precocity Paradox
	Children who peak early may also stagnate early. Humans exhibit the longest time to maturity in brain development. In healthy individuals, the longer the brain growth, the better the ultimate outcome
	A harmful illusion that we can accelerate child development over long-term prospects. Developmental delays can be a result of neurophysiological problems.

- Abstraction 
	Knowledge that forms the "big picture", the "core" it relies on rules & formulae rather than facts
	in learning: 
	maximize the following:
	1. usability 
	2. applicability
	3. abstractness of knowledge
- Generalization
	A process where detail is ignored to reveal a deeper structure
	overlaps w/ abstraction, conceptualization, inductive reasoning, modeling, theorization, categorization, conclusion, unification, colligation, de-concretization, pattern extraction, pattern separation, 
- Concept
	A generalization of a set of objects/nouns.  It overlaps with idea, entity, notion, group, etc. 
- Rule
	A generalization of an observed regularity
- Model
	A set of rules that apply to specific phenomenon. Overlaps with theory, metaphor, opinion, schema, etc.
- Abstract knowledge
	Well generalized, highly applicable knowledge that is conceptual/abstract in nature
- Abstract thinking
	Conceptual computation on rich and complex abstract knowledge
- Conceptual computation
	computation that occurs in a concept network
	reasoning, inference, or thinking are used colloquially to refer to conceptual computation
	Three ingredients of human intelligence:
	- Concept network - makes the mind's hardware with two essential attributes (1) network-level reward for self-organization (2) function-dependent architecture
	- Memory - software of the mind that is largely based on micro-structural changes
	- Conceptual computation - 
- Abstraction vs. Generalization

Learn day and night
Self discipline is easy when it emerges from passionate goals
Abstract knowledge - pay attention to the quality of knowledge and its general applicability

Two component model of memory
Stability (S) - how long a memory can last if undisturbed and not retrieved
Retrievability (R) - probability of retrieving a memory at a given time

Two types of people: 
Communicators (C) in pure science, they care about the truth
Persuaders (P) trying to persuade some idea is true. Science sometimes slowly transforms to join Class P. C-P dichotomy very interesting. Expansion? 
Missionaries (M) - truth is supreme, but also care about the change  (Science missionaries. )

Four threats to health in the modern day
sleep - generally okay, sleep without alarms, use bladder & light as a standard wake-up mechanism
food - solved via plant based, can tweak and optimize via recipes, etc. 
exercise - currently the biggest weakness, escalators, cars, etc.  mobility became effortless in the modern day
school

- Maladaption
	(Maladaption as it relates to systems that produce individuals) 
	(it can also be a human's adaptation rate on society)
	The future comes fast, but it often leaves ideas in the past, such as: old habits, systems, etc. that prioritize the survival & spread of values, in much the same way as organisms evolved to persist, vs evolve to more effectively manipulate or take care of the environment
	Only adapts in so much as it needs to to survive and spread.
	Brain damage by school, which undermines the love of learning, which lowers the amount of choices in adult life & serious consequences for mental health.
	- 
	- mental torture, to subject students to a form of sleep deprivation, control via 

Do you think it's possible to develop a kind of school system, in the same way that Netherlands developed their biking/public transit infrastructure?
What are the conditions for this to exist?
- The first is probably that behavioral boundaries need to be widened
- Second is that social media needs more boundaries, in order for the damage caused to not spread
- Third, a checklist for genius, health, sleep etc.

Anti-conditions
stress, sleep deprivation, toxic memories
	* Toxic Memories
		Futile memory - a memory of abstract concepts that has poor grounding in student's current knowledge
		Persistent memory - a memory with high stability that is hard to displace via interference
		Interference: a process of overwriting old memories with new memories (retroactive interference)  The prime cause of forgetting
		Parasitic memory - persistent memory that is false and does not want to go away
		Toxic memory - persistent or parasitic memory that becomes associated with anxiety or fear

Is it possible for me to have had a lifelong problem with learning?  All of my problems have been residually caused by the schooling of my past. Years of my life have been lost. 
It wasn't until my 30s did I start crawling back from it. Age 27 when I joined the military was finally an inflection point. I learned that I didn't always have to just do what I was being told, but put my own creative spin on it. The Army actually gave me more freedom than my catholic schooling. and the leadership was much more professional than the leadership I was exposed to. Catholic school is on the decline, and instead of adapting, they resort to 
I need to learn about this because I really want to figure out

Advice: Don't take school too seriously
